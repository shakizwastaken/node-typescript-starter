# Typescript Starter

A boilerplate project for building TypeScript applications with Node.js. It includes essential development tools like nodemon for hot-reloading, TypeScript for type-checking, ts-node for running TypeScript files directly without compilation, tsc-alias for creating module aliases, and tsconfig-paths for resolving paths configured in the tsconfig.json file.
