To get started with this project, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/shakizwastaken/node-typescript-starter.git

 ```
 ```
 "npm run build" : Compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript
 ```
 ```
 "npm run clear" : Deletes the build directory and node_modules folder
 ```
 ```
 "npm run clear:build": Deletes the build directory

 ```
 "npm run tsc": Compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler
```
